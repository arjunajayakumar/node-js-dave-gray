- npm init
- package.json
- installing a production dependency
- installing dev dependency
- NPM scripts
- importing a package with an alias
  eg 1: const { v4:uuid } = require('uuid');
  eg 2: import v4 as uuid from 'uuid';
- semantic versioning
  eg: "uuid": "^11.1.0"
  here 11 means major version, 1 means minor version and 0 means patch
  carrot or '^' means allow updates to minor version and patch and don't touch major version
  tilde or '~' means update patch and don't  touch other two
  eg: "uuid": "*" means update every time - not safe
- install specific version of npm packages
  eg: npm i uuid@8.3.1
- update an npm package
  eg: npm update
